# Pipe and Filters Design Pattern #

This project demonstrate the use of Pipe and Filters Design pattern. This pattern was something that was discussed as a solution to one of the problems that arose during an implementation discussion at work. As a result I decided to implement a possible solution that fits our scenario to demonstrate how the design pattern works.

More information on the design pattern could be found at the following links:

Hope this would be useful.
